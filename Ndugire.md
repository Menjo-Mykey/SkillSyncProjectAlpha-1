# Assignment Documentation: SkillSyncProjectAlpha

This assignment involved cloning a Git repository and navigating directories. I created a new feature branch, modified the README.md file, and documented the procedure using proper commands.

## Steps Taken

1. **Clone the Project Repository**
   - I navigated to the desired project directory using the `cd` command.
   - Within that directory, I cloned the repository to my local machine using the command:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/rcacfs/SkillSyncProjectAlpha.git
     ```

2. **Verify Project Directory**
   - To ensure the project was successfully cloned, I listed all directories using:
     ```sh
     ls
     ```
   - Then, I navigated into the project directory with:
     ```sh
     cd SkillSyncProjectAlpha
     ```

3. **Open Project in Visual Studio Code**
   - I chose to proceed with the project in Visual Studio Code, launching it using:
     ```sh
     code .
     ```

4. **Create a New Branch**
   - I created a new branch named `feature/Ndugire` using:
     ```sh
     git checkout -b feature/Ndugire
     ```

5. **Modify README.md File**
   - I added the statement "Enjoying course so far" to the shared `README.md` file.
   - After saving the changes, I executed the following commands to stage, commit, and push the changes respectivbely:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial Commit"
     git push -u origin feature/Ndugire
     ```

6. **Create Ndugire.md File**
   - While still in the VSCode terminal, I created a new Markdown file using:
     ```sh
     touch Ndugire.md
     ```
